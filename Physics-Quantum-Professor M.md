### State space vs Euclidean space

Euclidean space is a geometric concept of flat space described by real-valued coordinates and standard distances, while **state space is an abstract, multi-dimensional vector space used to represent the condition of a dynamic system at any given moment**. 

**State space** is often a **complex vector space with potentially infinite dimensions**, and its "points" are vectors that capture the system's variables, unlike Euclidean space, where points have fixed, real coordinates.

# The QM Postulates

[Postulate 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJoWM9jf0gU&t=119s):  
The state of any physical system is characterised by a state vector in a **complex** vector space, which will be called the **state space of the system**.

[Postulate 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNFna7zZbgE):  
A physical property A of a system is described by an **operator A acting on the state space,** and **this operator is observable**.

[Postulate 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1zg-c1nvwQ):  
The result of a **measurement** of a physical quantity is one of the **eigenvalues** of the associated observable (operator), and the state of the system after the measurement is the corresponding **eigenstate** of the operator.

[Postulate 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1R3kRWh1ek):  
The measurement of A (a physical quantity of the system) **in a normalised state, psi** gives eigenvalue lambda-n with probability: 

**P( lambda-n ) \= | \< Un | psi \> |^2**

Where **Un** is the nth eigenstate of the measurement operator for the physical property A.

# Position Representation of QM

[Wave functions in quantum mechanics, Professor M does Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lr3aA4vaBs&t=321s)

The position representation of quantum mechanics describes quantum states and operators using the basis of position eigenstates, which are the states of definite position. It represents a quantum state as a wave function, 𝜓(𝐫), which gives the probability amplitude of finding a particle at a specific position 𝐫. 

This is a fundamental framework for **translating quantum mechanical problems into a language of functions, much like the classical mechanical problems are described by position and momentum**.  

Key concepts

* [Position operator:](https://www.google.com/search?pws=0&gl=us&cs=0&sca_esv=99f76dd4c2fc864c&sxsrf=AE3TifPN1vB_nE6acnFQ5hoTHHXYhcmEjQ%3A1760865827266&q=Position+operator+%28%5Chat%7B%5Cmathbf%7Br%7D%7D%29&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwivwcKw-K-QAxWPif0HHfsdGI4QxccNegQIJxAD&mstk=AUtExfCAZORgybIpYgQxkHsXPZQetkQ6fMX8pKRm7Qu1egod9H9Rp20VKWo0F62NL6IvOPJqelr5CU_BUL9_-Aaus0sTT3Ok6JNG5_89Ah4smUV4nq9cE6psTfaVOOvChW75Aqut1UOUZfpNAnPTKUCc64ss84YYADtUWZj50Haf8YjJl2W5Ah6w1kMr9hpeP3c_ySVXZDOhm5o8iA1zSrNbNsb1b99xAJMqhFFq9eJfRkLS_O5s6ESAompQ2-orrwxovINE6rZcfLbl8-ffVY6GOIE3&csui=3) An operator that corresponds to the position observable. In the position representation, the position operator simply multiplies the wave function by the position vector: 𝐫̂𝜓(𝐫)=𝐫𝜓(𝐫)

* [Position eigenstates |𝐫′⟩](https://www.google.com/search?pws=0&gl=us&cs=0&sca_esv=99f76dd4c2fc864c&sxsrf=AE3TifPN1vB_nE6acnFQ5hoTHHXYhcmEjQ%3A1760865827266&q=Position+eigenstates+%28%7C%5Cmathbf%7Br%7D%27%5Crangle%29&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwivwcKw-K-QAxWPif0HHfsdGI4QxccNegQILRAD&mstk=AUtExfCAZORgybIpYgQxkHsXPZQetkQ6fMX8pKRm7Qu1egod9H9Rp20VKWo0F62NL6IvOPJqelr5CU_BUL9_-Aaus0sTT3Ok6JNG5_89Ah4smUV4nq9cE6psTfaVOOvChW75Aqut1UOUZfpNAnPTKUCc64ss84YYADtUWZj50Haf8YjJl2W5Ah6w1kMr9hpeP3c_ySVXZDOhm5o8iA1zSrNbNsb1b99xAJMqhFFq9eJfRkLS_O5s6ESAompQ2-orrwxovINE6rZcfLbl8-ffVY6GOIE3&csui=3): The eigenstates of the position operator represent a state with a precisely known position. These states form a complete, orthonormal basis. 

* [Wave function 𝜓(𝐫):](https://www.google.com/search?pws=0&gl=us&cs=0&sca_esv=99f76dd4c2fc864c&sxsrf=AE3TifPN1vB_nE6acnFQ5hoTHHXYhcmEjQ%3A1760865827266&q=Wavefunction+%28%5Cpsi%28%5Cmathbf%7Br%7D%29%29&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwivwcKw-K-QAxWPif0HHfsdGI4QxccNegQILhAD&mstk=AUtExfCAZORgybIpYgQxkHsXPZQetkQ6fMX8pKRm7Qu1egod9H9Rp20VKWo0F62NL6IvOPJqelr5CU_BUL9_-Aaus0sTT3Ok6JNG5_89Ah4smUV4nq9cE6psTfaVOOvChW75Aqut1UOUZfpNAnPTKUCc64ss84YYADtUWZj50Haf8YjJl2W5Ah6w1kMr9hpeP3c_ySVXZDOhm5o8iA1zSrNbNsb1b99xAJMqhFFq9eJfRkLS_O5s6ESAompQ2-orrwxovINE6rZcfLbl8-ffVY6GOIE3&csui=3) The quantum state is represented as a function of position, 𝜓(𝐫)=⟨𝐫|𝜓⟩. This function is the projection of the state vector onto an arbitrary position eigenstate, and its squared magnitude, |𝜓(𝐫)^|2, is the probability density of finding the particle at position 𝐫. 

* [**Schrödinger equation**](https://www.google.com/search?pws=0&gl=us&cs=0&sca_esv=99f76dd4c2fc864c&sxsrf=AE3TifPN1vB_nE6acnFQ5hoTHHXYhcmEjQ%3A1760865827266&q=Schr%C3%B6dinger+equation&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwivwcKw-K-QAxWPif0HHfsdGI4QxccNegQIFxAB&mstk=AUtExfCAZORgybIpYgQxkHsXPZQetkQ6fMX8pKRm7Qu1egod9H9Rp20VKWo0F62NL6IvOPJqelr5CU_BUL9_-Aaus0sTT3Ok6JNG5_89Ah4smUV4nq9cE6psTfaVOOvChW75Aqut1UOUZfpNAnPTKUCc64ss84YYADtUWZj50Haf8YjJl2W5Ah6w1kMr9hpeP3c_ySVXZDOhm5o8iA1zSrNbNsb1b99xAJMqhFFq9eJfRkLS_O5s6ESAompQ2-orrwxovINE6rZcfLbl8-ffVY6GOIE3&csui=3)**:** In the position representation, the **time-dependent Schrödinger equation** is written in terms of the wave function and its derivatives with respect to position, providing a practical way to describe how the state of a system evolves over time.
