### Observer transformation vs Particle transformation

[Symmetry in physics and Noether’s theorem Dr. Jorge S. Diaz ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtqHlDwCk-g&t=263s)

In physics, the key distinction is that an observer transformation is a change in the coordinate system used to describe a fixed physical reality, while a particle transformation (or active transformation) represents an actual physical change of the system itself, relative to a fixed coordinate system. 

> Observer Transformation (Passive):

- Definition: An observer transformation is a change of coordinates, such as a different orientation of the measuring equipment (rotation) or a different state of motion (boost). The physical system itself remains unchanged.

- Principle: Physics dictates that the results of an experiment should not depend on the choice of coordinate system used by the observer. Therefore, physical laws must be invariant under observer transformations.

- Example: Two scientists describe the same particle's motion. One uses a coordinate system oriented North/East, the other uses a system oriented Northwest/Southeast. Both describe the same physical event, and their descriptions are related by an observer rotation transformation. 

> Particle Transformation (Active)

- Definition: A particle transformation is an actual physical operation performed on the system, such as rotating a laboratory setup or accelerating a particle source, while the observer's coordinate system remains fixed.

-Principle: If the laws of physics possess a certain symmetry (like rotational symmetry or Lorentz symmetry in a vacuum), performing a particle transformation results in a new physical situation that is equivalent to the original one.

- Example: A scientist conducts an experiment, then physically rotates the entire apparatus 90 degrees and repeats the experiment. If the outcome is the same, the system exhibits rotational symmetry. 

> Key Relationship

In standard theories, like special relativity in a vacuum, observer and particle transformations are simply the inverse of each other and are often used interchangeably to express symmetry principles. 

> The Role of Symmetry Violation

The distinction becomes crucial in theories that violate fundamental symmetries, such as theories that explore Lorentz violation (like the Standard-Model Extension, or SME). 

In these cases: 

-Observer symmetry is always expected: A mere change in coordinates can never change the underlying physics.
-Particle symmetry can be broken: The theory might include a fixed background field that pervades the universe. If you physically rotate your experiment relative to this fixed background field (a particle transformation), you might detect a measurable effect, which would not happen if the universe had perfect rotational symmetry.
