### Observer transformation vs Particle transformation

[Symmetry in physics and Noether’s theorem Dr. Jorge S. Diaz ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtqHlDwCk-g&t=263s)

In physics, the key distinction is that an observer transformation is a change in the coordinate system used to describe a fixed physical reality, while a particle transformation (or active transformation) represents an actual physical change of the system itself, relative to a fixed coordinate system. 

> Observer Transformation (Passive):

- Definition: An observer transformation is a change of coordinates, such as a different orientation of the measuring equipment (rotation) or a different state of motion (boost). The physical system itself remains unchanged.

- Principle: Physics dictates that the results of an experiment should not depend on the choice of coordinate system used by the observer. Therefore, physical laws must be invariant under observer transformations.

- Example: Two scientists describe the same particle's motion. One uses a coordinate system oriented North/East, the other uses a system oriented Northwest/Southeast. Both describe the same physical event, and their descriptions are related by an observer rotation transformation. 

> Particle Transformation (Active)

- Definition: A particle transformation is an actual physical operation performed on the system, such as rotating a laboratory setup or accelerating a particle source, while the observer's coordinate system remains fixed.

-Principle: If the laws of physics possess a certain symmetry (like rotational symmetry or Lorentz symmetry in a vacuum), performing a particle transformation results in a new physical situation that is equivalent to the original one.

- Example: A scientist conducts an experiment, then physically rotates the entire apparatus 90 degrees and repeats the experiment. If the outcome is the same, the system exhibits rotational symmetry. 

> Key Relationship

In standard theories, like special relativity in a vacuum, observer and particle transformations are simply the inverse of each other and are often used interchangeably to express symmetry principles. 

> The Role of Symmetry Violation

The distinction becomes crucial in theories that violate fundamental symmetries, such as theories that explore Lorentz violation (like the Standard-Model Extension, or SME). 

In these cases: 

-Observer symmetry is always expected: A mere change in coordinates can never change the underlying physics.
-Particle symmetry can be broken: The theory might include a fixed background field that pervades the universe. If you physically rotate your experiment relative to this fixed background field (a particle transformation), you might detect a measurable effect, which would not happen if the universe had perfect rotational symmetry.

# Hamilton's Principle aka Principle of Least Action

Hamilton's principle, also known as the **Principle of Least Action**, states that the actual path a physical system takes between two points in space and time is the one where the "action" (the integral of the Lagrangian, \(L=T-V\), over time) is stationary (usually a minimum). Instead of minimizing total energy, it finds the path that extremizes the integral of kinetic energy minus potential energy, leading to the system's equations of motion via calculus of variations, offering a powerful alternative to Newtonian mechanics. 

> Key Concepts: 

- Lagrangian (L): The difference between the system's kinetic energy (\(T\)) and potential energy (\(V\)).
- Action (S): The time integral of the Lagrangian, \(S=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}L\,dt\).
- Stationary Path: The actual path followed by the system is where the action is an extremum (minimum, maximum, or saddle point).- Calculus of Variations: Applying variational calculus to the action functional (setting the variation of the action, \(\delta S\), to zero) yields the Euler-Lagrange equations, which describe the system's dynamics. 

> In simpler terms:

Imagine a ball rolling down a hill. There are countless paths it could take from point A to point B. Hamilton's principle says the ball will follow the specific path that makes the total "action" (kinetic energy minus potential energy over time) an extremum, often the minimum, compared to any nearby, slightly different paths. 

> Significance:

- **Provides a unified framework for classical mechanics, relativity, and quantum mechanics.**
- Derives the equations of motion (like Lagrange's equations) from a single principle, making it powerful for complex systems.
- Highlights the underlying mathematical symmetry and conservation laws (like energy and momentum) in physics.
